# Spreadsheet Application - University Assignment  

This project is a **university assignment** for a Computer Science course.

It demonstrates the implementation of a simple spreadsheet application with features like formula evaluation, cell referencing, and error detection. 

The primary goal is to apply core programming concepts such as **object-oriented design**, **data structures**, and 

**algorithmic problem-solving** in a practical context.

ðŸ“– Overview

The spreadsheet application simulates basic functionality found in professional tools like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets. 

Users can input formulas, reference other cells, and receive real-time feedback on errors. This assignment emphasizes both 

technical accuracy and robust error handling to deliver a reliable solution.

## ðŸ“– Features  

- **Formula Evaluation**: Supports basic mathematical operations (e.g., `=1+2*3`).
  
- **Cell Referencing**: Allows referencing other cells (e.g., `=A1+B2`).
  
- **Error Handling**:
  
  - `ERR_CYCLE`: Cyclic reference detected.
    
  - `ERR_FORM`: Invalid formula syntax.
    
  - `ERR_EMPTY`: Referencing an empty cell.

## ðŸ§ª Key Test Cases  


- **Cyclic Reference Detection**: Ensures that cyclic dependencies are flagged with `ERR_CYCLE`.
  
- **Formula Computation**: Validates correct evaluation of mathematical expressions.
  
- **Error Detection**: Tests proper handling of invalid or empty cells.

ðŸŒŸ Future Enhancements

Advanced Functions:

Extend functionality to include operations like SUM, AVG, and conditional formulas.

User-Friendly GUI:

Add a graphical user interface to allow users to interact with the spreadsheet visually.

File Support:

Enable importing and exporting spreadsheets in common formats like .csv or .xlsx.

Performance Optimization:

Optimize formula evaluation and error detection for larger spreadsheets.
