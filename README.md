# Spreadsheet Application - University Assignment  

This project is a **university assignment** for a Computer Science course.
It demonstrates the implementation of a simple spreadsheet application with features like formula evaluation, cell referencing, and error detection. 
The primary goal is to apply core programming concepts such as **object-oriented design**, **data structures**, and **algorithmic problem-solving** in a practical context.

---

## ðŸ“– Features  

- **Formula Evaluation**: Supports basic mathematical operations (e.g., `=1+2*3`).
  
- **Cell Referencing**: Allows referencing other cells (e.g., `=A1+B2`).
  
- **Error Handling**:
  
  - `ERR_CYCLE`: Cyclic reference detected.
    
  - `ERR_FORM`: Invalid formula syntax.
    
  - `ERR_EMPTY`: Referencing an empty cell.  

---

## ðŸ§ª Key Test Cases  


- **Cyclic Reference Detection**: Ensures that cyclic dependencies are flagged with `ERR_CYCLE`.
  
- **Formula Computation**: Validates correct evaluation of mathematical expressions.
  
- **Error Detection**: Tests proper handling of invalid or empty cells.

## ðŸŒŸ Future Enhancements  

1. Adding support for advanced functions like `SUM` and `AVG`.

2. Implementing a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user interaction.
  
4. Expanding file support for import/export capabilities.
